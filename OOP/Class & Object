Class : Class is a block of code which contains data(attribute) and functions(method), these are called Class Members.

Object: Class Members can be accessed by an Object, it is a reference of a Class.

# Syntax:
class class_name:
    data1...                -> Attributes (Class variables, shared by all instances of the class)
    data2...
    def function1(self):    -> Methods, 'self' is an implicit reference
        self.var1           -> Instance variable, unique to each instance of the class
    def function2(self):
        ...

obj1 = class_name()         -> Object instantiation
obj2 = class_name()

obj1.data1                  -> Accessing Class members
obj1.function1()
obj2.data1
obj2.function1()
class_name.data2
class_name.function2()


# Example:
Student Class                       class student:
    RNo                                 Rno = 123
    Name        Data                    Name = "Ram"
    Branch                              Branch = "CSE"
                                        def read(self):
    read()                                  print("Reading")
    write()     Functions               def write(self):
                                            print("Writing")
