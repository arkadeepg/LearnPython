Encapsulation: wrapping-up of data. Combining Variables/ Attributes and Methods in a single place, which is achieved by restricting the scope of Class members.
               Scope restriction is done by access specifies: public(default) & private.

# Syntax

class class_name:
    attr = None                # default Public attribute
    def method(self):          # default Public method
        print()

class class_name:
    __attr = None              # Private attribute
    def __method(self)         # Private method
        print()

obj = class_name()
