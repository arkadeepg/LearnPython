# Inheritance: acquiring the properties

Base/ Parent Class -> Derived/ Child Class
    variables               variables
    methods                 methods
        |                       |
      object                  object

Child Class can acquire properties of Parent Class.
Objects of Derived Class can access variables and methods of Base Class. Objects of Base Class cannot access members of Derived Class.


# Single Inheritance: 1 Base Class and 1 Derived Class
