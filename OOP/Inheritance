# Inheritance: acquiring the properties

Base/ Parent Class -> Derived/ Child Class
    variables               variables
    methods                 methods
        |                       |
      object                  object

Child Class can acquire properties of Parent class. Objects of Derived Class can access variables and methods of Base Class.


# Single Inheritance: 1 Base Class and 1 Derived Class

class Parent:                   # Base Class
    var1 = None
    def display(self):
        print("PARENT")

class Child(Parent):            # Derived Class Inherited from Base Class
    var2 = None
    def show(self):
        print ("CHILD")

obj1 = Child()

obj1.show()
obj1.display()


# Multi-level Inheritance: more than 1 Base and Derived Class. eg: Grandparent, Parent, Child

class Grandparent:                  # Base Class of Parent
    def gdisplay(self):
        print("Grandparent")

class Parent(Grandparent):          # Base Class of Child, Derived Class of Grandparent
    def pdisplay(self):
        print("Parent")

class Child(Parent):                # Derived Class of Parent
    def cdisplay(self):
        print("Child")

c1 = Child()

c1.gdisplay()
c1.pdisplay()
c1.cdisplay()
